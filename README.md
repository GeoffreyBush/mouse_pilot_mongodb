# MousePilot
## Animal Colony Management System

MousePilot is an open-source web application that provides a centralised repository for tracking mice used in experimentation, and aims to create consistent, real-time data transfer between the site where mice are bred and the site where research is planned and carried out. It is designed to be used by small or medium-sized research facilities that have an in-house breeding facility.

This is a fork of a project that was initially developed as a 3rd year undergraduate software engineering project at the University of Aberdeen in collaboration with the Institute of Medical Sciences at Foresterhill Health Campus. It was forked to replace an SQLite database with PostgreSQL and incorporate Alpine.js and HTMX into the front-end.
