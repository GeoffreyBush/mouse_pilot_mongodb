            This page is for adding a mouse that needs to be imported to the MousePilot central repository manually. For example, if the mouse was bred before MousePilot was deployed at the facility, or if the mouse was purchased from a vendor.

            This page is <u><b>not</b></u> for moving a mouse from breeding cages to stock cages. That functionality can be found in the "Transfer to Stock" button in the "Breeding Cages" link on your left.
