                This page is for adding a mouse that needs to be imported to the MousePilot central repository manually. For example, if the mouse was bred before MousePilot was deployed at the facility, or if the mouse was purchased from a vendor.

                For now, you can only add one mouse at a time. Future plans include functionality to add multiple existing mice at once through a spreadsheet import or batch creation.

                This page is <u><b>not</b></u> for moving a mouse from breeding cages to stock cages and you would create duplicate mice by doing so. 
                Use the "Transfer to Stock" functionality found in <a href="{% url 'breeding_cage:list_breeding_cages' %}">Breeding Cages</a> for that purpose.
